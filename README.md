# New-York-Taxi-Fare-Prediction
The task is to predict the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations. While we can get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two points, which will result in an RMSE of $5-$8, depending on the model used. The challenge is to do better than this using Machine Learning techniques!
